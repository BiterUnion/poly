|Framework| Modding Framework
=========================================

|Framework| is a mod framework for `Factorio <https://factorio.com/>`_.
It provides modules that simplify various aspects of modding Factorio, e.g., creating and managing custom GUIs.

|Framework| uses object-oriented programming for many of its features. For this, |Framework| provides a convenient class mechanism, that automatically handles setting and persisting objects' metatables. It is recommended to familiarize yourself with |Framework's| :doc:`class_mechanism` before starting to use |Framework's| modules.
